The project consists of setting up a virtual laboratory for educational purposes in Pakistan because virtual Reality laboratories are computer based and highly interactive. With everything being digitized and modernized these days, its high time that educational and learning techniques be upgraded and made more effective. In a “virtual real” world, the user becomes a participant in an artificial three-dimensional optical environment. Since virtual laboratories simulate a virtual operating system, the computer screen, Science laboratories, exploiting the potential offered by modern media technology allow technical interaction and direct manipulation of objects and parameters.  
Laws in science arise from a detailed observation processes, with clearly more chances of clarification, understanding and acceptance if regarded in detail. To gain real understanding of scientific processes and concepts, practical work and experimentation is essential. Practical work not only encourages collaboration and communication between teachers and students but also lets STEM students participate actively in the learning processes by being able to have a hands-on experience of the theoretical concepts they learn: asking questions, trying to find answers, viewing objects from different angles and commenting on them, helping in formulating conclusions, understanding their mistakes and highlighting any misconceptions.
If the theoretical work was made into practical work by adding a new dimension of depth and making learning more comprehensible, the students will have more chances of contributing to the further growth and development of things.  
With meaningful object response to user actions, by the creation of objects with embedded behaviour. a high level of autonomy can be achieved. This can in turn be achieved by embedding some kinds of behaviour to virtual objects, for example by allowing virtual world designers to "program" objects to respond in some way when they receive stimulus from the user.
For example, we have introduced the concept of this project by setting up a DLD Lab in VR where students can build the digital circuits from discrete components and analyze them by using computerized circuit simulation methods via Virtual Reality Technology and observe the respective outputs of various inputs.. 
This shows the need for virtual reality technology that does not simply allow the creation of impressive 3D interfaces but also allows the user to explore and view effects of certain stimuli from various angles and perspectives. This way the true purpose of laboratories can be attained.
We propose that a Virtual Laboratory should be set up that can present the student with a synthetic world where he/she will have the greatest possible extent of freedom, so that he/she can freely experiment in real time to comprehend the various phenomena going on around them. 
The synthetic world in the virtual laboratory should consist of a virtual space with all the necessary tools to conduct an experiment be it related to Physics, Chemistry and/or Biology. The user must be able to combine these tools
and learn from his experimentation. 
Though whether such an application will adequately serve educational needs depends on the realistic behaviour of the objects, the precision of the visual data, and the level of complexity that has been used to represent the natural laws or principles governing the specific field, its application will certainly have a positive impact on the learning outcomes of students
